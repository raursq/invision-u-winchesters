# inVision U — AI-Assisted Admissions Platform

> **AI finds the evidence. The committee decides.** Every competency level the
> system shows comes with the applicant's own words as the quote, against the
> university's behavioural rubric, and says so plainly when there is no evidence
> rather than scoring it low.

Built by team **Winchesters**

🏆 **Top 4 out of ~5,000 participants** at **Decentrathon 5.0**, powered by inDrive  
🎯 **Semi-finalist** at **GovTech Camp**, powered by inDrive

## Overview

**The task.** inVision U, a university founded by inDrive, selects applicants
by potential: leadership, teamwork, values, motivation. The committee reads
every essay, video and interview by hand; polished writing wins, and a
decision made by impression is hard to explain or check.

**What we built.** An admissions platform where *AI finds the evidence and the
committee decides*:

1. **Applicant portal**: a five-step application and a short real-life
   scenario with a neutral conversation partner, in English, Russian or Kazakh.
2. **Evidence ledger**: for each of inVision U's competencies, a level on a
   behavioural scale (BARS) backed by verbatim quotes from the applicant's own
   text, each checked word for word against the source.
3. **Committee dashboard**: the Committee Card with levels and quotes, an
   override with a mandatory reason that is logged, an interviewer brief and a
   decision memo.
4. **Fairness audit**: checks whether groups of applicants (for example rural
   schools) get lower levels than others. Background never enters scoring.

## The Problem

Standard university applications see **paperwork, not people**. Talented
students from rural areas get overlooked because they can't "sell themselves"
in a form, and the usual automated fixes (keyword counts, GPA weights, AI-text
detectors) penalise exactly the applicants who write in Kazakh or in an
additional language.

## What the platform does

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Evidence ledger** (LED-03/04) | For each competency: a BARS level (High / Normal / Weak / No evidence), the verbatim quote it rests on, the indicator it matches and the source (essay, written presentation…). "No evidence" is its own state, never a low score. |
| **Committee card, Interviewer Brief, Growth Map** (LED-05/11) | Three views of the same stored ledger: what the committee rates, what the interviewer should probe, what the applicant may later see. |
| **Committee override** (COM-01) | A committee member changes one competency's level with a mandatory reason code. Overrides are appended, never written over the AI level, and the history shows who changed what. |
| **Decision memo** (COM-04) | Russian / Kazakh memo and PDF with the evidence, overrides, bias probe, frozen version hashes and committee signatures. |
| **Fairness audit** (FAIR-07) | Share of each group rated High, per competency, with 95% bootstrap intervals and a 0.8 review line. Groups with n < 10 are marked "Not enough data". |
| **Swap and rescore** (FAIR-06) | Changes name, region, school type, language and speech style and checks whether any level flips. |
| **Video by people** | The applicant links a video presentation; the committee watches and grades it. The AI reads only the written materials (essay, interview notes, recommendation). |
| **Scenarios** (INP-04) | The applicant talks a real situation (team conflict, taking initiative, an honest choice) through with a neutral conversation partner, in English, Russian or Kazakh. Their replies are rated on the same rubric as the essays and shown to the committee as "observed in simulation", weight 0: never a change to the AI level or a rank. Without a key the partner follows a script (demo mode). |
| **Completeness view** (LED-01) | How much material exists per dimension, so the committee sees a candidate assessed on four sources apart from one assessed on an essay alone. It is not a merit score. |

**What scoring never uses:** school type, region, GPA, family income, gender,
application language, essay length or manner of speech.
`tests/test_no_demographics_in_scoring.py` fails the build if any of them moves
a score. The old AI-authorship detector was removed (LED-02). It flagged
non-native writing, and nothing calibrated for Kazakh exists.

## Status

Hackathon project. Planning notes from the competition are in
[docs/archive/](docs/archive/).

Working end to end:

- **Applicant**: sign up, the five-step application, review and submit; one
  scenario conversation in English, Russian or Kazakh.
- **Committee**: dashboard with search and filters; the Committee Card with a
  level and verbatim quotes per competency; the scenario result next to it at
  weight 0; level override with a reason code, kept in an append-only history;
  interviewer brief, growth map and decision memo (PDF).
- **Fairness audit**: group comparison per competency, with review flags.
- **Quality**: 445 backend tests pass; the whole demo path produces no 5xx
  responses and no console errors ([audit](docs/archive/led-12-demo-click-audit.md)).

The demo works **without any API key**. Every click reads from the database, a
cache labelled as one, or a deterministic baseline. Live-only endpoints answer
503 "nothing was scored" instead of an error.

### Running without a model key

The hackathon build was demoed without a funded model key, so these parts run
in a labelled demo mode:

- **The scenario partner follows a script.** The applicant
  types real answers; the partner's lines are pre-written, and the result is
  labelled *"Demo mode · scripted partner"*.
- **Ledgers run in demo mode.** A stand-in replaces
  the two model calls (`backend/ledger/demo.py`): the 16 seed applicants use
  quotes written once by hand from their own documents, and a newly submitted
  application gets a rule-based ledger on submission. Every quote still passes
  the real verbatim check, and levels, ATOLA gaps and probes come from the real
  rules. Each view shows the chip *"Demo mode · no live model"*. With a funded
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `python -m backend.ledger.cache && python -m backend.db init`
  replaces them with real runs.
- **The attribute-grouped fairness audit on the dashboard uses 200 synthetic
  profiles.** It is labelled "demonstrates the method, not evidence". On the
  real database it has no levels yet, so it shows no figures.
- **Evaluation harness, swap-and-rescore and cohort probe run the
  deterministic baseline** ("no model call" chip). Their 0% flip rate says
  nothing about the AI scorer yet.
- **Model card, funder memo and reproducibility** show "Unavailable": they
  need inVision U's historical admissions data.
- **7 of 9 rubric scales are drafts**, written from the published one-line
  competency descriptions.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4 (design tokens in `globals.css`) |
| Backend | Python 3.12+, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLModel + Alembic on SQLite |
| AI | Claude via `backend/llm.py`, the only place a model is called. Model ids come from `backend/settings.py` (`MODEL_JUDGE`, `MODEL_EXTRACT`, `MODEL_CHAT`). With no key, the call is refused before a request is built. |
| ASR | Off by default. ElevenLabs Scribe v2 only, behind `ASR_ENABLED` + `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` |
| Non-AI | Completeness reference, fairness statistics, deterministic fallbacks |

Prompt and rubric content is hashed and locked in
`backend/ledger/versions.lock.json`. CI fails on any change without a version bump.

## Quick Start

### Docker (only Docker Desktop needed)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in:

| Sign in as | Email | Password | What you can do |
|------------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Admissions committee** | `committee@invisionu.edu` | `demo2026` | Dashboard with 16 demo applicants, Committee Card with evidence quotes, level override, Fairness Audit |
| **Applicant** | `applicant@invisionu.edu` | `demo2026` | Fill and submit the application, then talk a scenario through (EN / RU / KZ) |

An applicant account submits one application; use **Sign Up** for more (any
email works, no confirmation). The database is created and seeded
on first start (the `backend-data` volume); `docker compose down -v` wipes it.
No API key is needed. To add one, copy `backend/.env.example` to
`backend/.env`: compose reads it at run time. Ports can be changed with
`FRONTEND_PORT` / `BACKEND_PORT`. The browser only talks to the frontend,
which proxies `/api` to the backend, so the same stack also works from a
phone on the LAN at `http://<laptop-ip>:3000`.

### Local dev (hot reload)

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/raursq/invision-u-winchesters.git
cd invision-u-winchesters

# Everything at once (venv, backend + frontend deps, backend/.env)
make install
make db-init        # create/upgrade the SQLite database and load the 16 demo applicants
make dev            # backend on :8000, frontend on :3000
```

Or by hand:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env   # AUTH_SECRET is required; ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is optional for the demo
python -m backend.db init
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8000
cd frontend && npm install && npx next dev --port 3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The demo accounts are
`committee@invisionu.edu` and `applicant@invisionu.edu`, both with the password
`demo2026`, seeded while `DEMO_MODE=1`.

- After pulling changes that touch `backend/migrations/`, run
  `python -m backend.db init` again. The API refuses to start on an outdated
  database and prints this command.
- `python -m backend.db reset` deletes the local database and rebuilds it from the seed.
- Tests: `python -m pytest`.

## Ethical AI & Fairness

- **PII stripped** before any text reaches a model (names, emails, phones redacted).
- **No background in the score.** Protected attributes are collected for
  auditing only, and no scorer imports them.
- **Levels, never averages.** Levels are counted per group and never turned
  into a 0–100 number.
- **Human in the loop.** AI levels are advisory. Overrides are recorded with a
  reason, and signatures are on the memo.
- **Explainable.** Every level rests on a verbatim quote from the applicant's
  own text. No evidence is shown as "no evidence", not as a weak result.
- **Honest labels.** Synthetic, cached, illustrative and fallback figures are
  labelled as such. A page with nothing behind it says "Unavailable —
  nothing was scored".

## Known Limitations

- Ledgers are demo mode until the cache is built with a key (see *Status*).
- 7 of 9 rubric scales are drafts. The COM-06 probe bank is provisional.
- No historical admissions data, so there is no agreement or fairness evidence
  on real outcomes. The model card stays empty.
- The Kazakh evaluation relies on the same pipeline as Russian and English.
  Cross-lingual agreement has so far only been measured on the deterministic
  baseline.
- The video presentation is for the committee to watch and grade themselves;
  the dashboard does not analyse it.
