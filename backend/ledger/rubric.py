"""The nine competencies, their indicators and their BARS anchors.

Two of the nine are public: inVision U published the full behavioural scale for
Leadership abilities and for Wounded leadership, and those are reproduced here
close to their wording. The other seven are drafted from the one-line
descriptions in the same deck and are marked `provisional`. The real scales
arrive with the extended methodology on Oct 5 and replace them wholesale, which
is why `RUBRIC_VERSION` is stamped onto every ledger: a score is only comparable
to another score computed under the same version.

Weights, cut-offs and the item bank are not here and must not be added. They
belong to inVision U and Talent Craft, arrive as configuration, and are
displayed in the product as theirs.
